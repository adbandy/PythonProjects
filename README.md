# My Data Science projects in Python:
**[Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Predicting%20Car%20Prices/Basics.ipynb)**: This project is about using the [k-nearest neighbors algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) to predict car prices.

**[Winning Jeopardy](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Winning%20Jeopardy/Basics.ipynb)**: In this project, a dataset of Jeopardy questions is used toÂ figure out some patterns in the questions that could help to win.

**[Building a Spam Filter with Naive Bayes](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Building%20a%20Spam%20Filter%20with%20Naive%20Bayes/Basics.ipynb)**: In this project, a spam filter function is written using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam and non-spam.

**[Mobile App for Lottery Addiction](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction/Basics.ipynb)**: A medical institute decides to build a mobile app to help lottery addicts to estimate the probability of winning. This project provides the engineering team of the institute some functions to calculate the requested probabilities.

**[Finding the best markets to advertise](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/Basics.ipynb)**: In this project I help an elearning company to find the best market to advertise in based on the [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969/).

**[SAT scores of NYC schools and Demographics](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Analyzing%20NYC%20High%20School%20Data/Schools.ipynb)**: This project analyzes New York City schools according to the SAT score and tries to find correlations between demographics like race, gender, class size, and more.

**[Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Star%20Wars%20Survey/Basics.ipynb)**: This project is based on the Star Wars survey of [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) team. The ranking and number of views are analyzed based on some factors like gender, education, location, etc.

**[Dissatisfaction in Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/nasimjafari7/PythonProjects/blob/master/Guided%20Project_%20Clean%20And%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys/Basics.ipynb)**: In this project, I work with exit surveys from two institutes in Queensland, Australia, and try to analyze if employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction.
